Elite Bullies - Application Status Management Guide
==============================================

To change an application's status to approved, you'll need to:

1. Access the Supabase Dashboard:
   - Go to https://app.supabase.com
   - Log in with your admin credentials
   - Select the Elite Bullies project

2. Navigate to Table Editor:
   - Click on "Table Editor" in the left sidebar
   - Select the "puppy_applications" table

3. Update Application Status:
   - Find the application you want to update using the email filter
   - Click on the row to edit
   - Change the "status" field to one of these values:
     * 'pending' (default for new applications)
     * 'approved' (for accepted applications)
     * 'rejected' (for declined applications)
   - Click "Save" to update the status

4. Status Change Effects:
   - When marked as 'approved':
     * Applicant will see "Approved" status when they check
     * They'll receive next steps for deposit payment
     * They'll get instructions for puppy selection
   - When marked as 'pending':
     * Applicant will see "Under Review" status
   - When marked as 'rejected':
     * Applicant will see "Not Approved" status

Security Note:
-------------
- Only authorized admin users should have access to the Supabase dashboard
- Never share admin credentials
- Always verify applicant information before changing status
- Keep track of status changes for record-keeping

Alternative Method (Using API):
-----------------------------
You can also update the status programmatically using the updatePuppyApplication function:

```typescript
const { data, error } = await updatePuppyApplication(applicationId, {
    status: 'approved'
});
```

Remember:
- Double-check the application details before approval
- Maintain consistent communication with applicants
- Document any special conditions or notes in the admin panel
